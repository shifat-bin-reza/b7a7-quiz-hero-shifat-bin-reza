            <p> <b>Map:</b> Map function loop through each items of an array and give all the values as result or can
                return values. <br> <b>Filter: </b> Filter method loop through all the items of an array and return
                values according to the condition given. <br> <b>ForEach:</b> ForEach method works like Map method means
                it loop through all the items of an array but the difference is it can not return any value. <br>
                <b>Find:</b> Find method works like filter method but the difference is filter method return all the
                values that matches the condition and find method returns the first value that matches the condition.

            <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-2 mt-8">Difference between Local storage, Session storage and Cookies.
            </h1>
            <p> <b>Local storage:</b> Local storage is used to store data that can access later. This data will always
                remain inside the local storage of the browser even after the browser or tab is closed. <br> <b>Session
                    storage:</b> Session storage is also store the data but the difference is when the browser or tab is
                closed it will automatically clear the data. <br> <b>Cookies:</b> Cookies are basically small files or
                information that generates by a web server and then sends to the web browser. </p>

            <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-2 mt-8">What is event loop and how it works?
            </h1>
            <p> The event loop basically monitors the call stack and callback queue. If the call stack is empty, then
                the event loop will take the first event from queue and then push it to call stack. This is how event
                loop works. </p>
